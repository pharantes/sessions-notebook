# Media Query - Interactive Learning Playground

This folder contains the **demo project** designed to accompany our learning sessions. It serves two primary purposes:

1. **Showcase the Session Concepts**: Provides a practical example to illustrate the topics covered during the session.
2. **Student Playground**: Offers a safe space for students to experiment and apply the concepts on their own.

## Purpose

The demo is a hands-on tool meant to bridge the gap between theory and practice. It provides:

- A **reference implementation** to understand the topic at a glance.
- An **interactive environment** for students to modify code, test ideas, and explore the session’s concepts in depth.

## How to Use

1. Pull your **cohort repository** onto your laptop:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Copy the demo folder to your `session-notebook` directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r demo /path/to/session-notebook/
   ```

3. Work from your `session-notebook` directory. Make all your changes and experiments there.

**Important**: You do not have the right to modify your cohort repository directly. Always work from the `session-notebook` copy.

## Learning Objectives

This demo helps students to:

- **Understand Core Concepts**: Review a practical example of the session's topic.
- **Practice Independently**: Use the demo as a sandbox to apply what they’ve learned.
- **Explore Creativity**: Experiment with variations and customizations to deepen understanding.

## Contribution

Students are encouraged to actively participate by:

- Modifying and extending the demo to explore new ideas.

## Disclaimer

This demo is intended for **educational purposes only** and may not cover all edge cases or scenarios. It’s a starting point for learning and experimentation.

Adding a **Material Share** section is a fantastic idea, especially if you want to provide additional resources or references like color palettes, assets, or links that students will need for the demo. Here's how you can include it effectively in the README file:
