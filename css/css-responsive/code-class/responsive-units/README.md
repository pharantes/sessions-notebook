# Responsive Unit - Interactive Learning Playground

This folder contains the **demo project** designed to accompany our learning sessions. It serves two primary purposes:

1. **Showcase the Session Concepts**: Provides a practical example to illustrate the topics covered during the session.
2. **Student Playground**: Offers a safe space for students to experiment and apply the concepts on their own.

## Purpose

The demo is a hands-on tool meant to bridge the gap between theory and practice. It provides:

- A **reference implementation** to understand the topic at a glance.
- An **interactive environment** for students to modify code, test ideas, and explore the session’s concepts in depth.

## How to Use

1. Pull your **cohort repository** onto your laptop:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Copy the demo folder to your `session-notebook` directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r demo /path/to/session-notebook/
   ```

3. Work from your `session-notebook` directory. Make all your changes and experiments there.

**Important**: You do not have the right to modify your cohort repository directly. Always work from the `session-notebook` copy.

## Learning Objectives

This demo helps students to:

- **Understand Core Concepts**: Review a practical example of the session's topic.
- **Practice Independently**: Use the demo as a sandbox to apply what they’ve learned.
- **Explore Creativity**: Experiment with variations and customizations to deepen understanding.
